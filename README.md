# kOS-RTLS-Landing

A kOS program that can precisely land a booster, SpaceX style. This is a WIP version and still needs quite a lot of work.

I recommend downloading this craft file: https://kerbalx.com/Patrykz94/Falcon-9

1. Place all of the files in your Ships/Script folder in KSP install directory.

2. Make sure that the kOS CPU on the booster has the boot file set to "boot_falcon".

3. OPTIONAL: Set the boot file of second stage CPU to "boot_testflight". Although this can really be any other launch program as long as it stages when engines don't have access to fuel and not when the fuel in the stage runs out completely.
